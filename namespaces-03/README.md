# namespaces-03

This module exemplifies how packages may be distributed across multiple files.

The `first` package contains two files: `hello.go` and `goodbye.go`.

Each file holds one public function definition: `Hello()` and `Goodbye()`.

These functions are then used by the `main` package, under the `first` namespace.
